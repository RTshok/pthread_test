- I have tested concurrency, and implemented it in my program.
- As algorithm to divide, i used prime factorization
- We can see from the graphic, that the more threads we use, the faster algorithm is going. But according to Amdahl's Law, using more and more processors won't give boost.

- There we can see the speed of algorithm using different amount of threads.
- So if we extrapolate the plot, we'll observe that increasing the amount of cores, won't boost our algorithm more and more.
